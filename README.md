This is my Information Security, Governance and Cloud Project - computation.py.

It computes mathematical problems with the application of functions:

1.] program that asks the user for a number of days. The program then prints out the number of seconds in the number of days given. 

2.] program that asks a user to input the radius then the program calculates the volume of a sphere.

3.] program to compute the area and perimeter of a square. The program should ask the user to enter a number corresponding to the side length of the square and display the area and perimeter of the square

4.] program using functions that determines whether a character input by a user is uppercase or lower case. 

5.] Python Program equivalent with a given pseudocode
